# hello-world
Let's hope having yet another place to store stuff will not make searching for files even worse.
I am quite concerned that storing some of my work on github will just lead to a situation, where I now do not only have to go through all my hard- and pen-drives, but also through gropbox AND github to find a file that I could have programmed faster from scratch, than it takes me to find it.
